# Tuples and Named Tuples 

This assignment demonstrates the role of tuples as container datatypes. Tuple is an immutable data container (which makes it different from list). Being immutable makes tuples more memory efficient, aside from providing better security in terms of protecting sensitive variables and their values. However, since tuples cannot be modified, the variables have to be accessed accordingly and the method is different from what is applicable in case of an array. “namedtuple” is a special case of a tuple which allows the developer to define a class and offers more convenient way to store and access immutable data.

## Pre-requisites

Faker is a library that has the capability of generating fake profiles of people – that contain information about the person’s name, address, occupation, blood group, and many such other fields. The module can be installed by using the following command:

pip install faker

#### Usage:
from faker import Faker

## Description of functions implemented in the current code


### profile_feature_generator_namedtuple()

This function accepts a keyword argument specifying the number of records that has to be  generated by the Faker library. It then takes into account a few fields – username, blood type, current location and age –  of the people represented in the records. Using the concepts of “namedtuple”, the data has been stored and such calculations as largest blood type, mean current location, age of the oldest person in the record and the average age has been performed.

#### Usage: 
profile_feature_generator_namedtuple(num_records=10000)


A brief description of the test cases that have been employed for the respective functions are as follows:

### Test to prove that namedtuple is faster

 A test case, test_session8_execution_time_compare, has been written to compare the time taken for the execution of the profile_feature_generator_namedtuple and the profile_feature_generator_dictionary function to demonstrate that the process of data processing and execution is expedited when “namedtuple” is used over dictionary as a data container type.

#### Usage: 
test_session8_execution_time_compare()



### company_profile_generator()

This function fetches the names of a number of companies (specified by the parameter num_records) and stores data related to their stock prices using the concepts of “namedtuple”. The data stored in the “namedtuple” are usually the price of the stocks during the opening, their highest price during the day and their price at closing. In addition, each of the companies have been allotted arbitrary weights which hypothetically reflect their market cap. Using the aforementioned knowledge, the weighted average of the opening price, the weighted average of  the highest price and the weighted average of the closing price has been calculated for each company.

#### Usage: 
company_profile_generator(num_records=100)
